# Netflix-Data-Analysis-SQL-Python
This project performs an end-to-end ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process on the Netflix dataset. We'll clean, analyze, and derive insights from the data using SQL and Python. This involves data extraction, efficient loading, transformation, and detailed analysis to uncover patterns and trends within the Netflix dataset.
# Project Title: Comprehensive Netflix Data Analysis Using End-to-End ELT

# Project Overview:

This project will undertake an end-to-end ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process, utilizing the Netflix dataset. ELT stands for Extract, Load, and Transform, which is a pivotal methodology in modern data engineering. Our objective is to clean, analyze, and derive actionable insights from Netflix data using powerful tools like SQL and Python.

# Project Objectives:

# Data Extraction
Extract raw data from the Netflix dataset.

# Data Loading
Efficiently load the extracted data into a database for further analysis.

# Data Transformation
Clean and transform the loaded data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

# Data Analysis
Perform in-depth analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the Netflix dataset.

# Tools and Technologies:

# SQL
For data extraction, loading, and performing various transformations and analysis tasks.

# Python
For advanced data processing, manipulation, and visualization.

# Key Deliverables:

Cleaned and Transformed Data: Ensure the dataset is free from duplicates, null values, and any inconsistencies.

Analytical Reports: Generate reports and visualizations depicting key insights such as popular genres, viewing trends, and more.

Data Pipeline: Establish an automated pipeline for ongoing data extraction, loading, and transformation.

# Expected Outcomes:

A robust, cleaned, and analyzable dataset.

Comprehensive insights into Netflix data trends.

Enhanced skills in ELT processes, data analysis, and using SQL and Python for real-world data projects.
